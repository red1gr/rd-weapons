ðŸ”« Config.Weapons

This section sets custom recoil and camera shake values for specific weapons.Each weapon is referenced by its hash key (using GetHashKey), and assigned:

recoil: How much the weapon pulls the aim off-target when fired.

shake: How much the screen shakes when the weapon is fired (affects visual feedback).

Example:

[GetHashKey('WEAPON_PISTOL_MK2')] = { recoil = 0.3, shake = 0.03 }

Means that firing a Pistol MK2 will cause moderate recoil and a slight screen shake.

ðŸ’¥ Config.DamageModifiers

Defines custom damage multipliers for specific weapons.These values scale the damage output for the weapons listed.

Example:

[GetHashKey("WEAPON_UNARMED")] = 0.9

This means that unarmed attacks deal 90% of the default damage.

[GetHashKey("WEAPON_PISTOLSNS")] = 0.37

SNS Pistol will only deal 37% of the default damage, making it a weaker weapon.

ðŸŽ® Config.DisabledControlsWhileAiming

An array of control input codes that should be disabled when the player is aiming.

These prevent actions like:

Light melee attack (140)

Heavy melee attack (141)

Alternate melee (142)

Melee block (143)

This ensures cleaner combat behavior when using firearms by restricting unintended melee inputs while aiming.

ðŸ§  Config.CriticalHits

A boolean flag that controls whether critical hits (like headshots) are allowed:

true: Headshots and other critical damage areas do extra damage.

false: Critical hit multipliers are disabled (headshots do not instantly kill).
